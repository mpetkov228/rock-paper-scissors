# rock-paper-scissors

Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is a version of the popular game with a simple ui.

It displays my understanding of beginner programming concepts such as:

  - Variables
  - Conditional statements
  - Loops and iteration
  - Using functions
  - Using built-in JS modules (Math etc.)

After adding the ui, I've gained some experience concepts:

  - Selecting and manipulating DOM elements
  - Using DOM element methods
  - Adding events to DOM elements
