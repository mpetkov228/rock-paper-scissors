# rock-paper-scissors

Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is a version of the popular game, played entirely on the console.

It displays my understanding of beginner programming concepts such as:

  - Variables
  - Conditional statements
  - Loops and iteration
  - Using functions
  - Using built-in JS modules (Math etc.)
